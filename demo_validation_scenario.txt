DEMONSTRATION: How Validation Fixes AI Hallucinations

=== BEFORE VALIDATION ===

AI Generated Recommendation:
- Action: SELL
- Entry: null
- Stop-Loss: $88,000 (WRONG - should be above entry for SELL)
- Take-Profit: $40,000 (-55% crash in 12h - UNREALISTIC)

Problems:
1. Entry is null - cannot execute trade
2. Stop-loss is below entry (wrong direction for SELL)
3. Target implies -55% crash in 12 hours (impossible)

=== AFTER VALIDATION ===

Market Data:
- Current Price: $90,000
- ATR (1h): $2,000

Validation Applied:
- Fixed entry_price: null → $90,000 (current price)
- Fixed stop_loss: $88,000 → $95,000 (entry + 2.5×ATR = protection)
- Fixed take_profit: $40,000 → $82,000 (entry - 4×ATR = realistic)

Final Recommendation:
- Action: SELL
- Entry: $90,000
- Stop-Loss: $95,000 (5.5% above entry - protects against upside)
- Take-Profit: $82,000 (8.9% below entry - realistic 12h target)
